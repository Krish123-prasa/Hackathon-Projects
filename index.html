    <p >Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. </p>
    <p>The oldest transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ('Bolognese Memorials'), in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary</p>
    <p>while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th century in the Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery)</p>
    <p>It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagna, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets, boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.</p>

    <p >Muslims in Al-Andalus began rice cultivation around the 10th century. </p>
    <p>Consequently, eastern Iberian Peninsula locals often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts.</p>
    <p>Along Spain's Mediterranean coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.</p>
    <p>Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish "symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman and the Arab.</p>
